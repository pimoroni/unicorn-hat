You are using this at your OWN RISK. I believe this software is reasonably safe to use (aside
from the intrinsic risk to those who are photosensitive - see below), although I can't be certain
that it won't trash your hardware or cause property damage.

Speaking of risk, WS2812 pixels are bright enough to cause eye pain and (for all I know) possibly
retina damage when run at full strength. It's a good idea to set the brightness at 0.2 or so for
direct viewing (whether you're looking directly at the pixels or not), or to put some diffuse
material between you and the LEDs.

PHOTOSENSITIVITY WARNING:
Patterns of light and darkness (stationary or moving), flashing lights, patterns and backgrounds
on screens, and the like, may cause epilleptic seizures in some people. This is a danger EVEN IF
THE PERSON (WHICH MAY BE *YOU*) HAS NEVER KNOWINGLY HAD A PHOTOSENSITIVE EPISODE BEFORE. It's up
to you to learn the warning signs, but symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, vision changes,
convlusions, disorientation, involuntary movements, and eye twitching. (This list is not    
necessarily exhaustive.)

It's a good idea to read these. They include advice for how to protect your NeoPixels against
shorting out, and how to use a capacitor to ensure smooth power delivery.
